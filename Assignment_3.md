# Assignment 3: Methodology 
## Evaluating how urbanisation in the future can account for rising sea levels and the other issues that accompany it
by Milton Zuanic

## Introduction
Sustainable cities and communities across the world are at risk due to rising sea levels and the threat it possesses. Across the planet, 190 million people are located on land predicted to be below high tide lines in the year 2100(1). This number does not include the number of locations at risk of flooding and other water-based natural disasters. This increase in high tide lines does not only threaten homes but also food supply and palatable water. Depending on the economic state of a nation, as well as its development, response to rising sea levels differ. Japan has had a long history of handling tsunamis, which have only increased in danger in recent years, has built thousands of kilometers in sea walls to limit the population from risks. Japan, in the modern era, is viewed as one of the most developed nations in the world. In line with this view would be Japan’s not only rapid response to ocean-based threats but also their preparation and reaction to them at the moment. When these forms of disasters occur people are alerted via a nationwide cellular update, a warning to get to high ground or shelter immediately in response to earthquakes that could cause Tsunami. Not only is the population response rapid but the amount of time given to the population is increased due to the towering sea walls slowing down these tsunamis. What followed the 2011 and 2014 major Tsunami was a plan for Japan to invest over $12 billion into maintenance, development, expansion, and building of sea walls across the nation(USE OLD SITE). Even this rapid response has its own handful of issues, obstructing access to the ocean, quality of life, etc. On the other hand, however, nations far less developed than Japan may not have the infrastructure capabilities to make such a definitive investment into its people. This is made even harder when the nation in question has its population separated by large masses of water such as in the Philippines. 
Since the 1950s the population of the Philippines has increased by over 80 million people(3). This rapid growth led to hasty industrial planning, poor placements of city developments, and a mass increase in farmland output. This output is strained today to keep up with producing enough food each year for the population it feeds. By looking at an example case within the Philippine’s current rising tides issue and pairing that with some data science methods to plan their future, predict their danger areas and prevent a mass dislocation scramble of their population. By employing existing agent-based models, digital elevation models (DEM), geographic information systems (GIS) paired with spatial statistics I hope to answer the question of whether or not large populations can be relocated sustainably without threatening current ways of life within urbanized areas in light of new coastlines. To answer this question I will start by evaluating the agent based-models. These are used to predict population response; in this instance, response to Tsunami allows one to understand which environments have the highest survivability rate and plan future cities to mimic those environments (4). The DEM calculates the depth/height of land. Over the years these methods have been enhanced by producing more reliable data that does not get distracted by foliage and other terrains. This method allows for a clear understanding of which areas are likely to see imminent flooding due to high tides changing as opposed to the occasional floods caused by tropical storms(1). And then lastly, employing GIS and spatial statistics as well as population projections one can understand and plan proactively for how introducing a new demographic into a “mega-urban environment” might impact the local infrastructure(5,6). 

## Inquiry Type
The primary predicament with rising tides addressed in this paper will fall under urban planning which can be answered using an evaluative question. This particular inquiry allows for a base to be created from which sustainable urban planning can follow to prevent irreversible damages in the future. This planning will take into account future coastlines, communities that will need relocating as well as the threshold in which existing cities can handle their own growth with additional population injections from these displaced communities. By monitoring current communities in high tide regions, for example, the island of  Ubay, one can understand the rationale behind the community’s reluctance to relocate, even with the assistance of the government(7). Using the two models along with the geospatial data and population projections gives a rather robust base to begin a sustainable urban development plan. An issue, such as rising tides, is rather black and white on the surface. Predicting what populations are at risk becomes a simple evaluation of current data on the height of regions above sea level. The difficulty in taking measures against such an issue arises in the timing. In the world’s current state high tide level growth rates have increased and are predicted to be just under 2m higher by the end of the century (2).  This takes into account rising levels of carbon emissions(low, medium, and high output) up until the end of the century. The rate at which carbon emissions change has a direct impact on the state of the ice levels in the arctic. When all this is taken into account there is a 5% chance of over a 2m rise in high tide lines by the turn of the century. With rising high tide lines, there will be adjustments with coastal lines. Depending on the makeup of the coast, coastal erosion may be expedited, rivers will spill over constantly while expanding and more people will be forced to make a choice of living life in high risk flood areas or attempting to start life anew in the city. The population demographics, accounting for language, ethnicity, and religion amongst other covariates, will play a major role in the decision making of those in small communities attempting to relocate. How the government responds to these covariates can lead to them understanding how to incentivise moving. In turn there will be complete guaranteed safety. This relies heavily on the actions of the government as well as the overall trust people have in said government. Some variables that will briefly be acknowledged throughout will be sustainable development of cities, from water potability, food resource sufficiency, and healthy population growth within the confines of future coastlines.  

## Methods
	
Digital Elevation Models 

Digital elevation models are created from a conglomeration of other datasets to produce accurate geographical models incorporating terrain, depth and consistency. Often these models have two versions, a DTM that is considered the bare earth model and the DSM, which considers vegetation and buildings in the mapping(8). The main focus for this inquiry will be DTM for the purpose of understanding at risk areas of flooding as well. When paired with DSM this can be very effective at understanding at risk locations with buildings and populations. This can play into future urban planning and understanding as well to acknowledge certain areas near cities as inhospitable for informal settlements to form as well. In this particular DEM a new base data set is being evaluated and compared to an older base data set to see if the newer one will provide a more accurate picture for global mapping. With the advancement of more accurate DEM’s monitoring, constantly changing coastlines will become easier and more efficient and not require constant validating of the data. The changes in coastlines in the coming years requires a more robust and reliable system which can allow for effective urban planning in the future. To assist in the prediction of future coastlines, understanding the following equations is pivotal.

						Sr,	t=Sg,	t+So,	t+Vt

Sea rise (Sr) is accounted for by the relative sea level rise (SLR) in year t(m).  Sg  has t  quantified as global SLR in year t. So has t quantified as regional sea level change induced by oceanic changes in year t(m). Finally vertical land movement (V m/year) where t equals the number of years in the future (in this regard base year was 1990)(11). 

A very important facet of understanding the new SLR is the acknowledgement that there will be new potentially inundated areas (PIAs). This was accounted for by manipulating the DEM information.

The DEM flow allows for the data to be processed and produces four different outcomes in the same area dependant on the SLR whether it rises 1m,2m,3m, or 4m. This image was created by creating the potentially inundated models first and then overlay in the city of Richmond on top to provide a visual of the extent the flooding has on the community.

1m SLR	B) 2m SLR	C) 3m SLR	D) 4m SLR

Ultimately this model supplies 2 simple but important equations that explain the overall impact of the inundation in regards to the SLR amount. 

Population affected=% of area lost through flooding (1m, 2m, 3m, 4m)× total population
Dwellings affected = \% of area lost through flooding (1m, 2m, 3m, 4m)× total dwellings

These variables are a simple but defined way of tracking potential impact of the SLR in any situation. Applying this base model to other regions of the world, assuming depth can be better predicted with an uncertainty value less than 1m then countries can reliably trust these models to prepare for the worst case scenarios. 

## Population Projections and Geographic Information Systems
The population projections for a nation have alway been pivotal in understanding the nation's ability to develop in different aspects of functionality. These projections are calculated through estimating improvements in: healthcare, food supply, potable water, amongst other covariates. Understanding one’s population projections allows for proper inclusive economic growth, urban planning and general sustainable development. Particularly in cities under development the importance in the sustainable growth of these environments is pivotal upon the way this data is utilized by the government. Are certain ethnicities ostracized within cities, relegated to the outskirts or living in informal settlements. In relation to the main question, are these informal settlements sustainable in the development of these cities or will other forms of affordable need to be supplied. Informal settlements being taken over to build new affordable housing lose their importance when the settlement and its dwellers choose to relocate their settlement instead of making use of the government sponsored developed housing. These new settlements may be under threat of new high tide lines, a very realistic threat. 
	In regards to population projections there are varying degrees of detail. In its simplest form the methodology of population projection follows this equation:

Pc,t = Pc,t−1 + Bc,t − Dc,t + Mc,t, 

This equation, known as the demographic balancing equation, accounts for P - the population, c - country, t - time period, B - births, D - deathes, and M - net international migration. The UN Population Division employs the cohort component method to project age and sex in future time periods. This requires further inputs; some of the inputs include projections of projections of future total fertility rates (TFR), sex ratio at birth, male and female life expectancies, along with a number of historical data. The historical is helpful in making predictions due to constantly running census being a costly and inefficient method of monitoring a population. With this predicted population there is a lot of room for uncertainty(9). To counter this issue the UN creates a high medium and low variant by adjusting certain inputs by one or two. Future values of TFR (bayesTFR) along with simulation of life expectancy trajectories (bayesLife) convert each trajectory into a future trajectory of all sex - and age-specific populations. Combined with the R package (a collection of functions and data sets)  from bayesDem probabilistic projectiosn of the TFR and life expectancy are produced from one single interface.

The world population prospects acknowledge direction by that government policies carry heavy responsibility in incorporating this form of data early. Accounting for rising tides is one major impact tht the future will have world wide but infrastructure improvement to handle such an immense issue requires government intervention now. Particularly when the largest growing population group is the 65 and older demographic with improving health services worldwide. This particular demographic requires a stable living environment because rapid response to natural disasters particularly from an informal settlement does not bode well for the survivability of this demographic evidenced in the employment of Agent Based models.


## Agent Based Models

Agent based models are employed to understand a certain population's reaction to certain stimuli. In this particular issue response to flooding and tsunami are important when considering where coastal lines might be at the end of the century. This type of model supplies the individuals in the particular environment with autonomous behaviors based on likelihood of certain actions occurring. The reliability of these models leans on the data inputted into the model. Parameters are required to be set up (acknowledging interactions between agents), then environment (island, city, and terrain), and certain infrastructures or information that may be known beforehand (i.e. safe locations or high ground or evacuation zones). The value of this particular type of model appears when understanding the case at hand. For example Manila in the year 2100 faces a plethora of variables: what new urban development plants may be input (new buildings and informal settlements), new ethnic people relocated into the city from islands now below high tide lines potentially ostracized and living in seperate informal settlements due to lack of faith in the governments promises of affordable housing. All these different variables and more  can be accounted for by adjusting the inputs in the model. By the year 2100 certain ehtnic divides may not be as prominent, perhaps the strain of such close proximity of these ethnicities has built up animosity. The heterogeneity is the true strength of such a model although each new environment model will require major data development since it will be figmented. Governments employing this model may find certain responses as undesirable and could employ early policies to prevent such issues from arising. 


![fig 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60228362/80095591-2ee96f80-8536-11ea-9ebf-697b7f248c67.jpg)

In the case of Barrio Barretto an agent based model was employed to evaluate whether an area with potential of being impacted by Tsunami but had yet to be hit by one might react in the face of a Tsunami(4). This particular model employed data on the buildings, shelters, inundated areas,and also the slopes of roads (GIS maps). Capacity of shelters and shortest evacuation paths were important factors included. For the agents, speed and age were the physical attributes monitored. When maximum capacity was reached in shelters agents were forced to find the next closest shelter. The final outcome was an estimated 20% survival rate. This leads to a general understanding that 80% of the population of the city were incapable of reaching a safe point on time(4). 

This type of data should be employed in the designing and addition of shelters in proximity to the locals. Certain factors that may not have been accounted for are certain interactions between demographics. Would younger more capable people force elderly to find the next closest shelter, or would they help previously, or as suggested by the model would the population fend for themselves (unlikely). However, 20% survival rate is pitiable and requires serious considerations to be made in redesigning of shelters and their capacity along with their accessibility. 

## Conclusion and Comparison

The DEM relies upon inputs with limited uncertainty values to accurately predict coastal depths before any form of future coastal alteration can be predicted. Once the final coastline predictions or handful of predictions are made there appears a relatively stable base from which one can build upon(1). However, without a smaller uncertainty value the overall digital map produced is far from suitable when planning future developments, particularly in urban environments(11). This method does suggest that with more refinement in the elevation variable would increase the viability of the model. The limiting factor in most DEMs lies in the outdated data from SRTMs from the 2000s(1). Now CoastalDEM consists of all the data produced by SRTMs and more creating a more robust model. 

The population projections, worldPop and bayesPop are both reliable and based off one another. The models are as accurate as the covariates entered into the system. Each year the predictions may become less accurate due to the base year getting further away every day. And basing the projections off of a projection would make little difference as well. Ultimately, a global census where all people are accounted for one year (although economically impossible) would create the most accurate population projection the following year. The variables that are accounted for by worldPop creates a picture of what trends may occur over the years with high and low estimates provided. The accuracy of this model has been proven over the years and ultimately the reliability of this model in understanding the general makeup of different parts of the world today and 100 years into the future is an immense resource very applicable to future urban development. 

Finally, the agent based mode supplies a simulation of instances that otherwise might be difficult to comprehend the scale of an issue. However, with certain inputs on the population, simple mapping supplied, and general restrictors and variables enforced one can get a relatively good idea of what a scenario might play out as. For more accurate models all that is required are more variables and multiple runnings of the same simulation to get an average outcome each time. The true value of the agent based model in the issue of future urban development in regards to new coast lines is how the newly composed population from different regions might react to one another in time of crisis, particularly when understanding whether living situation may be based on ethnicity or locality.

## Discussion

The utility of all these models combined exponentially improves the final product. With the initial base of digital elevation models one can easily create a base from which to build predictive models. In response to multiple inundated regions that are predicted to occur in the future the model has proven suitable to supply a range of assets available for testing. Using these different DEMs one can begin to predict how projected populations in 20 years may alter as these regions are forced to adjust to new tide lines. Ultimately in time cities will meet drastic changes. Whether these changes come directly from coast lines encroaching on city limits or if the coastlines indirectly force smaller communities to cohabitate in the same environment. In larger cities where informal settlements are common, “foreign” communities may be more welcome than cities without. These demographic ambiguities can be simulated by adjusting bayesPop models. Inputting a larger population into certain cities with different ethnicities, health, and heritage may drastically adjust averages in these locations. The risk of such large movements to these cities lie in the fact that informal settlements often fall on undesirable lands, suggesting the value or worth of the land is minimal. This may be due to the prone flooding that occurs and if this issue occurs now, one can only imagine the devastation that would occur in time as more people begin settling as rising sea levels begin to cause worse flooding, harsher storm seasons etc. The future of these cities lie in the urban planning done now. 

Using agent models on the predicted DEMs and projected populations one can simulate a response to tsunami or monsoon with the current state of buildings with projected population numbers. Of course this will show a major failure and ineptitude of keeping the population safe. The ultimate purpose of this model is to tweak the variables and see where people appear to funnel. Which shelters are most sought after, what regions have the most elderly, do the new inhabitants of the city choose to ignore government advice out of resentment and flee the city in hope of simply finding higher ground or slopes. From these different variables governments globally can begin enacting policy shelter development. Programs that incentivise moving to the city in new affordable housing to prevent reluctance of inhabitants seen in the island Ubay where people choose to live on an island flooded half the time because they trust their way of life more than the one the government hopes to give them. This shows weakness in current policies and should be a wake up call for governments to make the change as opposed to paying the price later with the lives of their citizens.

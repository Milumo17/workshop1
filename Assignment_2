## Introduction

The purpose of this research is to determine the viability of relocating large populations in response to rising sea levels around the world, particularly in LMICs in  South East Asia where it will be impossible to protect all its coastequally. To evaluate the current state of these coasts and cities several points must be noted. Firstly agent based models are employed to predict movements of population in moments of natural disasters. Matching this model with more detailed mapping and topography from digital elevation models (DEM) replacing an antiquated SRTM NASA model that struggled with vegetation interference. The DEM employs a neural network to prevent errors the old model failed to catch. Thanks to developing data methods new more accurate data is always being developed[4*]. 

 Does the at risk settlement have infrastructure in place on the coast protecting them from floods already, high sea walls or is there an evacuation plan in place already. It is likely more developed nations will have both while LMICs may have neither. But a key note is that a city must not just have a plan but also an early education of the plan to its people.  

##Human Development Topic

According to developing and changing data methods 190 million people are currently living below the predicted high tide line in the year 2100 [4*]. This data also acknowledges that those values do not take into account population growth over the next 80 years or the eroding coastlines. The predicted value is likely a low estimate at best. Some of the nations most at risk are aware of the situation. South East Asia for example has very few if any higher leadership or governing body that denies the veracity of global warming and rising sea levels.  Many believe that abiding by the UN’s new policies on lowering emissions that the prior mentioned rise in sea level could be avoided [7*]. This, however, is nothing but a misguided thought. The damage to the environment has been done and the rising levels of the seas is surely inevitable. Aside from the issues of mis preparation and false security there is also the fact that the world’s population will not cease to grow. If sea levels rise and the land that population dwells on decreases the density of cities will intensify leading to a multitude of other urban development issues. It is predicted that in the next 30 years there will be an overall increase in population by around two billion [16*]. Of that two billion 75 percent of that growth is predicted to come from 22 countries, predominantly Asian and African nations. In its current state, the island nation of the Philippines, for example, was estimated to have had about 650,000 people displaced due to disasters such as flooding, tsunami, storm surges and cyclonic wind in the year 2018[13*]. These statistics only stand to increase as the danger of the surrounding water will only increase as it rises. 

Amartya Sen claims that people have substantial freedom and well being are not the same; that is where an ethical issue arises. It is every man’s right to live freely and healthily to the best of their abilities. However, when faced with situations such as rising sea levels the issue arises where an overseeing impersonal government begins to get in the way of the local way of life. Whether that be a forced migration for the sake of the population against their will or the building of defenses against the will of the locals. Although it may seem illogical this issue is valid. In Japan’s Miyagi prefecture there is debate over the future of a planned sea wall after the devastating Tsunami from previous years claimed the lives of 18,000 across Japan 60% being from Miyagi[2*]. Locals state that their fishing lives will be disrupted and that their homes will become more of a prison than a quaint village. Statements such as “We've always coexisted with the sea and we don't like being cut off from it” unfortunately do not justify the prevention of the building proceeding. But at what point are the substantial freedoms being restricted. If people choose to live their life dangerously on the waterfront it is their right to do so. 

Ultimately the issue of rising sea levels touch on many of the UN’s sustainable development goals, good health and well being (mentioned previously), industry innovation and infrastructure, and sustainable cities and communities. Investment in the infrastructure and defense of cities against rising sea levels protect many of Amartya Sen’s principles of freedom allowing for people continue living their lives’ free; free from the danger of nature. These investments are vital for the future of many developing cities in South East Asia where a mass migration is impossible. As plans are drawn up and put into action it must be acknowledged that there is a finite amount of resources capable of being invested into defense and ultimately land will be lost. It is important to decide where and how much each government is willing to lose to preserve its people's freedoms. 

## Human Development Process

Although it may seem that nature will impact every nation equally it is not the case. The greatest difference can be seen when comparing two countries affected by the brutality of the ocean; Japan and the Philippines. Regardless of how people may ultimately feel about putting up “great walls” in Japan[14], just the ability to economically carry out such a feat and put it into practice immediately shows both economic and governmental cohesiveness that many developing countries lack. After Japan’s most recent devastating Tsunami the government invested over $12 billion to build sea walls in new areas and in areas where sea walls slowed down the tsunami (not stopped) the walls were built higher[6*]. The Philippines in comparison has spent very little on flooding relief in general and a perfect example comes in the form of a small town easily forgotten. One of the many that could be forgotten in the years to come. Somini Sengupta shares the story of a town just north of Manila that's life was changed forever in one moment. One day the water came (flooded) and never went away. Now the small town of Pariahan is partially submerged in knee - waist high water. The government has stated they have intentions to relocate the people but have yet to enforce anything. They still go to church, the children get ferried to school. Economically those who remain are living soundly. They actually are more afraid to face the economic issues of housing than leave their homes raised above the water. The difficulty of substantial freedom is that the risk has not been ignored, rather fully accepted and incorporated into the way of life. Something more important than safety is in the water, their security of mind. The failure of the government is to put these people in a situation where they feel they can live most freely outside of the government’s safety[10*]. When looking at migration one has to acknowledge the fact that the population moving must be received and that it is not simply a temporary move towards a camp as disaster relief may normally be. Particularly in cities throughout the Philippines crime and socioeconomic issues can cause friction among the people. Some cities would be more attractive than others depending on the state of IFS, what demographics may dwell there as well as which are thriving (informal settlements). All of these factors can be accounted for through the use of data. The true difficulty of this process lies in the timeline aspect. How far ahead in the future should be looked into for the different projection data sets being employed. Because planning for 2050 and 2100 have drastically different numbers of people at risk. 

Amartya Sen makes a point that expanding the freedoms of the individual are innate to humankind. In many parts of the developing world racial violence and crimes run rampant. Manila is a perfect example of a city filled with multiple ethnic people, however, it is far from harmonious[9*]. Many informal settlements contain different ethnicities and are very accepting to new migrants. The more developed portions do not look so highly upon these migrants. Forcing a migration of people into the center of Manila would cause friction and intensify a challenge that already exists between the link of crime rates and migrants[9*]. Supplying people the freedom of choice or the illusion of choice allows for people to be supplied with the freedom to live their life under their choice. Instead of preparing for the coming disaster alone, the incorporation of directed development could be instituted. Making a new city or settlement and developing it for both industry and housing would address economic, housing, and freedom concerns. If done without corruption or bias targeted migration could catalyze the development of these LMICs.




## Geospatial Data Science Methods

There are three different areas that geospatial data can be employed to address the issue of rising sea levels. Projection of at risk areas and the accuracy of these affected regions as well as accounting for the erosion of coasts and changing topography allow for more targeted and accurate planning within each nation. Reliable mapping paired with coastal erosion projections show the area that could effectively be worked upon in the targeted years 2050 or 2100. The second point looks at the infrastructure of the at risk communities as well as their density in relation to each other ultimately finding whether migration is viable or defense is required. Poorer nations must prepare in advance due to their lack of economic ability understanding that some areas will require to be left behind. If large economic hubs could be defended then the future of the nation may remain somewhat stable. Finally the demographics of these nations as well as their projected development allow for more cohesive intermixing of communities. Once the first two steps are employed new regions could be developed attracting people, drawing them away from the coasts by choice far before they are forced to leave.  

Predictions for population affected in China range from 29-64 million to 30-100 million depending on the instability of the Antarctic. The ability to live freely logically begins with a safe and stable home. According to CoastalDEM paired with SRTM it is found that 70% of all people to be displaced worldwide will fall within the borders of eight Asian countries, “China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan[4*]. Kulp even warns that China alone amasses 18-32% of global extreme coastal water level (ECWL) ie) a large portion of the at risk coast. Beyond the powerhouse nation of Asia there are other smaller island nations at risk as well. The UN refers to these nations as “Small Island Developing States (SIDS)[4*]. In just over seven years the advances in these data sets are remarkably different. Due to a myriad of issues from lack of detailed data to a different state of global pollution. Even in 2012 there was an acknowledgement of the weaknesses of the tools at hand, and to combat this issue they used a top down and bottom up method and compared the two instead of hedging bets on one set over the other an ultimately used both GRUMP and Landscan to map out the population in relation to the given census data, one before input and one post[8*]. One of the major setbacks acknowledged in the discussion notes that s  between the two only appeared in the small island nations due to the area of evaluation each was capable . One was able to monitor it fully while the other could only capture a portion, a serious issue when trying to plan for the future on data that is half complete. 

Across available projections from the UN worldPop of populations above the age of 65 in the year 2100 are predicted to amass 22.6% of the total population and in South-Easteren Asia the number actually is higher at 30.4%. This projection predicts that Europe, Australia and other regions will be overtaken by South-Eastern Asia. Overall certain drivers impact the population changes greatly such as fertility, mortality and international migration[16*]. The same data projects that across the world the average number of live births per woman will average around 1.9. SIDS have a change from 1990 - 2100 of 3.2 to 1.8 average number of live births per woman. 

Hana Sevcikova employs bayesPop to project population for all countries and is used in the UN world population prospects mentioned previously[11*]. These methods developed account for even more demographics than the ones highlighted by the UN, data that when evaluated closer could aid the prediction of migration patterns when aspects such as ethnicity and heritage are added. Creating an agent based model requires extensive details to be inputted. The more details on the population surrounding at risk communities the greater one can rely on the predicted model. 

## Discussion

Ultimately, likelihood of sea levels to cease rising are unlikely. Nations that are implementing their plans such as Japan [15] are ahead of the curve and will likely be prepared for the future change in sea levels. Japan’s haste can be attributed to its sense of need, the nation has been battered by Tsunami for millenia so it would make sense that in this part of the world they are the most prepared. Japan, as impossible as it may seem for LMICs to copy their actions, supplies developing nations with a general guide to limit the impact of rising sea levels through investment into Sea Walls to prevent outcomes like that found in the Philippines [10*]. To create the agent based model that assists these LMICs to formulate their plans require extensive understanding of the local topography [3*, 4*, 7*] as well as the development of existing populations and their proximity to each other [1, 8*, 14, 16, 17] and ultimately the demographic make up of these communities. The planned agent based model intends to show the path these at risk coastal communities shall travel and where they ultimately settle, likely in informal settlements in the city of closest proximity. The direction of the migration allows for these governments to track what population will move, where they plan to move and accordingly these nations’ next choice are crucial. Either the reinvigoration of existing cities to capably handle large influx of populations or the development of new regions to invigorate the economy and improve development prospects so that this response to a global crisis does not impact the nation’s development but rather propel these developing nations forward into the future.

Harrod-Domar’s model consists of units of an equation 
 output = capital + labor (numbers)

So to increase overall output of a factory nation the world (any scale) one would simply need to increase the capital invested into it (ie number of looms in a cloth mill) or labor force (number of workers within the mill) 

The two are not mutually exclusive, excess in either leads to wasted opportunity which is often the case in the real world
For poorer countries the missing link more often than not is the lack of capital investment

Rostow’s model consists of the stages of economic growth 
Investment → Capital → Growth →Income → Savings → Investment

This cycle is intended to be self sustaining but more often than not poorer nations are not capable of continuing let alone starting this cycle within their means

Rostow calculated that 5-10% increase in investment (id aid) would trigger the cycle and could even put the nation on a self sustained growth if aplied correcty and efficiently with the aid truly going to where it needs to….

Complex adaptive Symptoms

The concept of complex adaptive systems is present everywhere around us from “biological organisms, ecosystems, rivers, the human brain, flocks of birds, climate and weather.” The general state of life is not linear or organized but rather more “complex non-linear”. Seemingly unrelated subjects, such as the brain and weather systems can have similarities drawn between them when they are broken down simply into their numbers.

All these complex systems are all difficult or even impossible to predict. Any small change along the line could cause drastic change at a different point in the line. However this is not to say that one cannot predict the final outcome of the system, or rather one can generalize an outcome.

Each part of the system plays an impact on the final outcome whether the part falls in line with the others or goes against the grain it effects the overall outcome. 

The variety and complexity allows for a diversity to be found due to different methodologies or ways of working towards the same Goal (ie the toaster) competition and alternate tools, no need to rebuild the wheel just better it/ differentiate it

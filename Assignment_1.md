Problem Statement

As Nations develop so do the cities within their borders. However, more often than not, this rapid development leads to an overwhelming rural to urban migration, the likes of which most cities are not capable of receiving due to a lack of infrastructure. In turn this leads to increases in ISFs (Informal settler families). These settlements bring a multitude of complications to the stability of these developing cities. Society/ urbanization could be slowed down due to the rampant crime, potential economic harm (businesses do not want to enter the city), no formal available housing and a lack of job opportunities. These issues can lead to great unrest particularly in young frustrated men. For cities under these situations they require greater development for stronger institutions particularly policing and housing. The policing will aid with public transportation being considered safe and reliable, an institution that assists people in more readily achieving their freedom of travel/ working ability. More jobs will supply people with a source of income and eventually a means of achieving more in life, maybe not for their future but potentially the next generation’s. A major question now is whether or not cities are capable of developing hand in hand with its ISFs to prosper together or must the city find a way to rid themselves of these hindrances to expedite their progress before these informal settlers become settled.

The ISF and its current state in the progress of Manila has heavily affected the city due to how deeply embedded the ISF’s have become within the city. It is an extremely polarizing topic politically. In one regard they hold an extreme importance in voter turnouts; on issues regarding urban development/ urban public officials particularly. To combat ISFs, new gated communities and private/exclusive spaces continue to pop up in various locations across metro manilla. The gentrification/ loss of these ISFs have varying effects on the population. Some of the residents of the ISFs are relocated because the image of these ISF's do not align with Manila's new urban plan.
These ISFs are appealing to those who have recently migrated.These regions are built up small little communities. However, these regions are becoming more and more distasteful to the eyes of those developing the rest of the region. Mixture of “middle and elite classes of the Philippines and the urban poor” pose a stark dichotomy not normally associated with the sparkling cities of the future. The mixture of these classes evidences the notion that there is a large readily available workforce that may be undervalued due to their financial/living situation, a situation that is relatively hard to track and constantly growing. “The number of people who cannot afford housing and therefore resort to Informal settlements has increased, with the latest estimate approximating 37% of Metro Manila’s residents live in slum areas.”
In regards to human development, these regions’ residents, particularly the ISFs, are searching for a better life and it is a part of this human development that should acknowledge their very right to work and live in the city freely. The sustainable development goal this source particularly targets is the industry innovation and infrastructure goal through its “housing policy and planning: striving for preservation and equitable development. Open street map is a resource used as the basis for a projection showcasing different regions in the metro manila area where different events have/will take place in regards to the gentrification of people. Another topic touched upon is the acknowledgement of civil unrest that may arise as the ISF population continues to be ostracized by the wealthier developing the city pretending that these informal settlement communities do not exist. 

2. “Philippines 2019 Crime & Safety Report.” OSAC, 25 Feb. 2019, www.osac.gov/Country/Philippines/Content/Detail/Report/d3be3560-6b42-4c0d-a621-15f4aea87572.

Crime and safety report advising citizens of the US how to take preventative measures in the philippines and other things to look out for. Crime Rates have slowly decreased and are currently lower than in the past two years, “nationwide crime rate dropped by 21.5% from July 2016 to June 2018 compared to the same period from 2014 to 2016”. Ride sharing has helped decrease petty crimes and taking advantage of locals and foreigners alike in regards to taxi fares. GRAB, UBER have all made the cheating taxi man almost obsolete. The report repeatedly mentions poor forms of public transport, particularly in Manila. Bus accidents occur often due to “poor maintenance or driver error” while ferry accidents are relatively frequent occurrences as well. These issues provide a strong representation for weak public infrastructure with minimal to no safety measures put into place. Beyond just public transport issues, there are also major issues with the unrest post election time. Acts of violence are common even during simple local office elections. These acts of violence expose a lack of infrastructure put into place. Lack of stability politically and security.
People do not have the freedom to vote as freely as they might please out of fear of violent repercussions. The right to leave ones home and safely go vote for the candidate one believes holds their values true is a core manifestation of development within a developed nation. This failure to uphold political stability, even if just locally, exposes a major favor on the side of the government. This source relates to the ninth Sustainable development goal “industry, innovation, and infrastructure.” In regards to human development, a lacking sense of political stability prevents much progress from occurring in regards to urban development since other infrastructures, particularly securities potentially, require more assistance initially. Another issue on the human development front falls upon the idea that unreliable public transportation prevents a reliable workforce on making it to work daily. This small part of daily activity must be resolved as the nation moves forward to guarantee the rest of society as a whole.

Population Studies, DOI: 10.1080/17441730.2014.902163
 
The article notes three aspects of migration that they hoped to find and learn more from through their small-area census data. The first being outward expansion of high-and low-growth clusters. The second is the development of new growth nodes on the fringes while the third focuses on the recent emergence of high-growth clusters in the core. To combat some issues faced when mapping data multiple data sets were layered coming from different places, such as data from government agencies geo-spatial data from Department of Environment and Natural Resources and list of state-approved economic zones from the Philippine Economic Zone Authority(PEZA) and non-governmental organisations such as Demolition Watch and land struggle hotspots form the Peasant movement of the Philippines. The purpose of the paper overall was to demonstrate the spatio-demographic approach in analysing recent trends in mega-urbanisation. Several of the evaluated barangay clusters (clusters of houses/community) went through demographic shifts all showcased through maps dated from the 1980’s to the 2010’s both centralized and on the fringes of the region with areas between relatively empty due to geographical limitations. 
 
Ultimately this study emphasizes the importance and moderate surface level success the philippines appears to have had with sustainable cities and their communities. This monitoring fo the growth in the region does not always track the direction from which the migrants travelled from but rather where they congregate once they settle . Another source that may assist in the writing on the topic may build on top of this resource with patterns and vectors potentially.

5. “Can Manila Outrun Its Population Growth With Smart Urban ...” Informal City Dialogues, The Rockefeller Foundation, 9 Nov. 2013, nextcity.org/informalcity/entry/can-manila-outrun-its-population-growth-with-smart-urban-planning.

This article is a more broad matter touching on the notion that this city really is at a crossroads in regards to many aspects of its future. The main one being whether it can truly embrace the opportunity within the chaos or if the chaos will consume the city and become its ultimate downfall. An interesting image on the site states, “Manila - How many people can a city hold? Inclusive policies can mean the difference between an urban realm that is crowded and struggling, and one that’s crammed with potential. Amartya Sen’s definition of human development are acknowledged in the site in sections referring to shelter, people having the right to a home and its security. How can one truly be free if they are never sure if they can stay in that one place for long in the end. This has been secured through the progressive reforms supply public housing to end evictions and resettlement. The reproductive Health Act and another program provide cash to indigent families for child education and maternal health. Both are important aspects to monitor when considering developed countries.

The article predicts that 2040 will see an exploded population with many unemployed and acknowledges that infrastructure, similar to the sustainable development goals, are necessary for the Philippines to move forward effectively into the future. Currently issues of hunger and housing are being met due to minimal urban planning but a far greater push is required to combat the ever snowballing effect that population growth carries with it. The question asked and answered is how can the population growth be slowed and to a certain extent it can be. Successful implementation of reproductive health law can slow growth but nothing can stop rural to urban migration. The government must look at the issues from the ground because just relocating families may create resentment and not be as convenient as some might think. Exorbitant public transport prices matched with the unreliability of public transport may make job opportunities unattainable. Poor design of these ISFs have also seen problems with weather and flooding and again is just not a sustainable way of life that can continue. Frustrations will rise and flare if the government takes too hands off a view of them.

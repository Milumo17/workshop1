“The City of God” presented a glimpse into the development or lack of development that Rio de Janeiro saw over the course of three decades. The theme of scaling occurs throughout the movie at multiple levels. The theme was brought up in the very first chapter of Geoffrey West’s book Scale where it mentions that as the size of anything increases other things will change as well, occasionally this is sublinear and other times it is superlinear. Throughout my essay I will discuss some of the supporting themes found in the movie with Scale as well as how the social networks developed faster than the city itself could keep up with in part due to the sheer control the networks held over everything. 

From the beginning of the movie there were the Tender Trio. They were rather low level thieves that robbed people here and there to get cash and occasionally give back to the community, like stealing the gas at the very beginning. The three of them wanted a good life with money and that greed led to their plan to rob the motel with lil dice. This heist would be there biggest score and ultimately their downfall. What interests me at this point in the movie is that after escaping and crashing into shorty’s cafe/bar area all the locals go along with the notion that they don’t know anything. Yes the boys threatened the patrons but I also believe that at this point as much as the trio acted tough they did give back to the community and probably did more for the community than the police. What followed surprised me. Why would Shorty tell the police, other than to spite the boys for crashing into his place. Initially I thought nothing of Shorty doing this but at this point in the city's development the police had as much if not more presence in the town (though a threatening one) than the trio had. Potentially Shorty was trying to get his own piece of influence in the town. As things die down with searching one of the trio turns to the church and becomes clean, and that was the last heard of him. The theme of escape peeks through from the very beginning showing that if something is desired enough, then one can will it happen. As the influence of the trio dissipates after three months of hiding the police presence increased immensely. 
As the trio begins to settle into life once again greed trips up Rocket’s brother. He sleeps with Shorty’s wife and ultimately thats what gets hum chased away by the police. The second major theme appears with his death and Shorty’s arrest. The idea that being too high and mighty and acting as if you were untouchable leads to a nasty reality check. The brothers' constant disrespect to Lil dice was not forgotten and Shorty’s grudge against the trio never faltered. Even under arrest he sees the last of the trio in his site and sends the police straight away. Not to his benefit, just to feed his rage. Even when they wanted to free themselves from the clutches of their deeds, they could not. This same idea occurs later on with Benny. Benny was lil dice’s main supporter and friend from young. The two of them were the start of the next wave of influnce in the region. Once they become of age (18) we witness there presence and aura on the town as they walk down the night life area and are greeted by all they see. This respect was not the varity that Dice wanted. He did not want mutual respect or trust. He wanted control. Control over everything and everyone. Ultimately he gets it. And in some ironic way, for a period of time Lil Z’s influence brought a calm to the city. Of course this calm was built upon addiction, corruption, and drugs. But in the eyes of Z this peace was a testament to his overall control of the city.
In the 70s Z had spread his influence across the city. People were either in his pocket (police), getting paid out of his pocket (any grunts all the way up to Tuba), getting their nose into his drugs, or keeping out of his site. All of these four options were safe, until Z wanted to grow even further. This environment that Rocket grew up around almost seemed impossible to avoid. And he dipped his toe into the water and considered attempting crime. But each time he wavered because of the good he found in each person he met. Beyond just Rocket however, it is clear that crime is superlinear just by looking at the sheer influence Z and his men have over children up to teens. The movie perfectly displays that frustrated young men with little opportunity (like rocket in the market getting fired) would turn to a life of crime and drugs because in the environment Z built where the police did not get involved it was safe and the safest to keep your family safe.
 Z and Benny control the entire drug market besides the corner they let Carrot have. An interesting way of looking at all those who had greed at some point, the tender trio, Benny, and Z, they all wanted more. Constantly wanting more. This idea that nothing could satiate the beast within. When the trio wanted to escape it wasnt that they were leaving their deeds behind. They were trying to escape with the deeds, it was their identity. There was no escaping to have a normal life because to have a normal after living a life of crime would be comparable to having died and come back to life anew. No one who entered the fray was able to escape. Steak is a good example of that. Picked up at a young age as a courier, built up until they make him kill someone. This final initiation rattles steak clearly but not enough to prevent him from living this life. It’s too late to go back for him and ultimately he dies as well. 
As Z distresses over losing his friend Benny, he begins to spiral and start swinging his influence around. Z reaches the point where crime is no longer keeping people but rather cornengin everyone. The movie displayed this perfectly. As the city slowly grows, with one action (the rape of Ned’s girlfriend and his response) the city erupts into a turf war. There is no longer 4 options to stay safe. There are two. And both involve getting into this life of crime. The sheer influence crime has over the city in one night erupts into a city of two fronts. It even reaches the point where the government can no longer ignore what is going on in the city. But even then the rate of corruption peaks. The police only go after Carrot and his gang not Z’s because Z has and will continue to pay them off. 

As the movie closes a clear message reigns supreme. Getting involved in this way of life has one outcome. There is no getting out of a life of crime. Either you die committing the crime, or you die escaping it. Not just the greed but rather the hunger people have for power completely blinds them to reason. But that is how the city developed. In a rush with a gang leader as the sphere of influence, the whole city is locked into a cycle that appears unbreakable and the only way to beat it is to outlive it. Whether that is possible or not appears to be up to the government and how much influence they are willing to make in the future.

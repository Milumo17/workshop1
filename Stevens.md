1) In the reading today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

The technique used is called “random forest” and it inclides detailed census and anicllary data in a felxible estimation technique. The model is flexible to the point that t can incorporate remotely sense and geospatial data from varying scales ito weighted portions of dasymetric models. 

2) The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?

The random forest method can respond to inputs and allows for certain simuli to change the random forest response. The ability for the method to automatically convert data into a similar scale (ie 100m --> 30m). The random forest model also slowly narrows in on finding related matters between two parts of the data. Using the forest that builds up it continuously fine tunes the acquired and adapted data. 

Dependent variabls and response variables along with covariates (geospatial) and predictors
3) In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

Talking of landcover 

4) The authors’ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?



5) Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?

I feel that using random forest methods I could use it to search for readily habitable land for the migration of smaller poorer communities away from areas along the coast that are prone to flooding and will in the next few years succumb to rising sea levels. Empty plots of land using night time mapping and CDR data combined would find uninhabited areas on a map. Then layering geospatial data on top describing topography, incline, vegetation density maybe wildlife trackers would also explain if that land was uninhabited for a reason, potentially like a lake or cliffs edge.
